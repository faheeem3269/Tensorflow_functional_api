ðŸš— Binary Image Classification with EfficientNetV2B0 This project implements a binary image classifier using transfer learning with the EfficientNetV2B0 architecture. The model is trained on a custom dataset consisting of two categories (e.g., car vs. truck) using TensorFlow and the Keras Functional API.
